# Enhancments

## Software Design and Engineering
[**Original Code**](https://github.com/jmmcbrayer/jmmcbrayer.github.io/tree/main/Software%20Design%20and%20Engineering/Original/LinkedList)  
[**Enhanced Code**](https://github.com/jmmcbrayer/jmmcbrayer.github.io/tree/main/Software%20Design%20and%20Engineering/Enhanced)

The artifact used for this enhancement was an application written during my CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms classwork called LinkedLists.  This was an application written in C++ that would provide the user with several options to input and work with bid data that was for a fictitious local government project.  The menu would ask the user for input to enter in a single bid information, import a list of bids into the application from a csv file, print the list, search the list, and remove a single bid as well.

I chose this artifact to include in my ePortforlio because my plan to satisfy this category was to port an application over from one language to another.  In this case I ported the C++ based application over to Python and was able to perfectly replicate the functionality of the original application and also provide several missing functions as well.  The specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities is to demonstrate my ability to develop a fully functional application, with proper code isolation using multiple files, and utilizing components of object-oriented programing that was partially absence from the original application.  I was also able to add in completely new features as well that include the ability to prompt the user for input for searching, removal, and filenames.

I was able to meet the course outcomes I planned to meet with this enhancement by fulfilling the requirements of the Software Design and Engineering sections but also demonstrating my ability to develop secure and reliable coding.  Each function is broken down into simple sections for easy support and error handling can gracefully deal with invalid input and provide useful information to the user instead of crashing the application.  At this point I do not believe there is any update needed for my outcome-coverage plans as the other sections will address the remaining items.

During the process of enhancing the artifact I was able to reflect and review the variations between these two programming languages and see where there are shortcomings and advantages to each.  One example is that in C++ it required another support application to handle the csv files that added more complications and overhead to the application.  In Python there is a csv library that simplifies this process and speeds up the implementation of that particular component.  As far as challenges as the original C++ application is not using objects to store data, but rather vectors I had to remember and/or figure out how to properly implement these using Python.  It took a little bit of reading online, but I was quickly able to wrap my mind around what was needed and implemented the classes to handle both the bid objects and to build and handle the list.
